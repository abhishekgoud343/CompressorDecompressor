# Compressor Decompressor

**Compressor and Decompressor** is a Java-based Desktop application built using the Java Swing toolkit. The application primarily provides the following two utilities:
  1. compress files with no data loss
  2. decompress the compressed files, i.e., restore the files.

## Compressor:
File compression allows the user to obtain a compressed version of a file, which occupies significantly less data storage space than the original file, without any permanent data loss in the conversion process. This allows the user to save space as well as to transfer files at higher speeds and with more convenience.

## Decompressor:
The compressed files can be restored through the process of decompression, whereby the user can retrieve the original file when required. This allows the users to easily compress and decompress files at will, when required, without any data loss.

## Instructions to run the Project locally
1. Open the project folder (```Compressor Decompressor```) in any IDE or code editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse etc.  
2. Run the java file at the location ```/Compressor Decompressor/src/GUI/Main.java```. This file contains the _main_ function and therefore the project can be executed by running the specified program file.  
3. The application will load in a new window.
